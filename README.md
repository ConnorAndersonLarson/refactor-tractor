## Abstract

Refactor Tractor is a project focused around accessibility, refactoring, and working with server side data. This was the first Brownfield project that we have encountered and required careful planning, constant communication, and consistent motivation to get to where we ended up at the end of the week. Major accomplishments include:
* Utilize Webpack and fetch requests to convert the project to a server styled data structure.
* Implement SASS to clean up stylings, add mobile responsiveness.
* Refactor Class structure to include inheritance and utilize classes to a better extent.
Overall this project was a great learning experience. We were able to take time to plan out our sprints, synthesize the original project, and implement new changes consistently with minimal merge conflicts.
